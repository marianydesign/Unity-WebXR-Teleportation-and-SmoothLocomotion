Within this Unity Project with WebXR (https://github.com/De-Panther/Simple-WebXR-Teleporter which is adjusted from https://github.com/IJEMIN/Simple-Unity-VR-Teleporter, both under MIT license) I integrated a C# script (https://github.com/msub2/) to be able to walk around with left controller from the Quest headset and teleportation with right controller. Credits to this developer.

Some more finetuning has to be done with both controllers. But first the basics are done.
